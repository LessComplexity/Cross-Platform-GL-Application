# Cross-Platform GL Executable Project
This is a simple template that comes with a [CMake file](CMakeLists.txt) that can be easily configured to work both on linux, windows and x86 or x64 architectures.

# How To
Clone the this project. Set the desired compilation directives in the CMake file, and then use a compiler (Visual C++ on windows or GCC on linux) to compile your GL program :)
